# Website Review - What's Missing/Needs Updating

## ✅ Complete:
- Navigation (matches original)
- Hero section (with real content)
- About section (Tarren McCall bio + photo)
- Our Approach section (3 steps)
- Products section (4 products with images)
- Success Stories teaser
- Footer (contact info, navigation, social links)

## ⚠️ Needs Updating:

### Contact Section:
- ❌ Heading: "Get In Touch" → should be "CONTACT US"
- ❌ Location: "New Zealand" → should be "Unit 3, 17 Joval Place, Manukau, Auckland"
- ❌ Phone: placeholder → need actual if available
- ✅ Email: correct

### Missing Sections from Original:
- "Want to Get on Stage?" page content (mentioned in nav)
- Detailed Success Stories page content (have teaser)
- Training Plans details (category 31)

### Navigation Menu:
Current: HOME | ABOUT US | OUR APPROACH | SUCCESS STORIES | NUTRITION & TRAINING | CONTACT US
Missing: "Want to Get on Stage?" link

### Other Issues:
- Some product prices say "Contact Us" instead of actual prices
- Need to check if all images are displaying correctly
- Mobile menu functionality
